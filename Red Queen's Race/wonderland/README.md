# Red Queen’s Race
## Bootcamp 2020 Project #4 Red Queen’s Race

In [Through the Looking Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Looking-Glass), Alice enters a world through a mirror where everything is reversed.

Alice and Red Queen are running to stay in place. They have to run faster to move forward. Each click increases their speed.
